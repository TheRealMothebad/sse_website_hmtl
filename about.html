          <h2 slot="title">Body Team</h2>
          <p slot="text">The body subteam is responsible for many of the vehicle’s major subsystems including our carbon fiber chassis and aerodynamic shell, the steering, internal structure, and the drivetrain. Recent projects have included designing and manufacturing a new rear frame, a redesigned engine mount, a new carbon fiber roll bar, a new drive chain & timing chain guard, and the steering mechanism. These projects decrease our vehicle’s weight and improve reliability, which helps to improve our fuel economy outcomes. Currently, the team has been developing a new chassis dynamometer for testing and tuning our drivetrain along with finishing touches to the body to comply with competition rules.</p>

          <h2 slot="title">Engine Team</h2>
          <p slot="text">The engine subteam tests the team’s engine by recording torque, horsepower and fuel consumption at our dynamometer to compare our modified engine to the original stock engine setup. This semester, the engine subteam’s main projects include sourcing and implementing a new ECU for our EFI system, dynamometer and engine integration, high compression engine build, and a rear subframe redesign. All of these projects work toward increased efficiency to decrease our fuel consumption. The engine subteam is also currently working on altering drivetrain gear ratio to run at an optimal operating condition, engine thermal management, throttle setup, and fuel system configuration.</p>

          <h2 slot="title">Electrical Team</h2>
          <p slot="text">The electrical subteam works with all the electronics, batteries, sensors, and controls in the car. They handle the manufacturing, testing, and installation of the electrical components and systems that are needed in the team’s car. The electrical subteam also makes sure all SAE rules regarding electrical systems and batteries are followed. This semester the main focus for the electrical subteam has been integration of vehicle position tracking, vehicle harness updates, and the steering senior design.</p>
